<p>Huang et al. [1] used two deep learning models, i.e., Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) to predict the traffic flow respectively.</p>

<p>Chen et al.[2] constructed a deep learning network using time series functions to extract traffic flow characteristics.</p>

<p>Koesdwiady et al.[3] proposed a holistic deep architecture to improve traffic flow prediction, in which DBNs were used for traffic and weather prediction and a correlation between weather parameters and traffic flow was investigated.</p>

<p>Based on multi-scale network and ConvLSTM,Chu et al.[4] proposed the MultiConvLSTM, which can extract temporal and spatial characteristics from historical data and metadata to predict the traffic of origin–destination .</p>

<p>Chu et al.[5] formulated the public transportation network as a graph, and developed a semi-supervised classification model based on Graph Convolution Network, which can directly on the graph-structured data with limited labelled data.</p>
